## Getting Started
This is a simple Next.js app that show you:
- A list of events
- A detail of each event
- A list of filtered events by year and month

For now (this is an exercise for me) it read data from a dummy-data.js file with static contents.
For the future the idea is make a dynamic read from a backend.
  
If you want to test this little app follow these steps.

First, clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pedrozebra/next-event.git next-event
```
After cloning, go into project folder and install the dependencies

```bash
cd next-event
npm install
```

Finally, run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
  

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
